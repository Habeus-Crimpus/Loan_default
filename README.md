# Loan Default Prediction Analysis
---
## Overview of the Project

Welcome to the loan default prediction analysis project! Based on the dataset sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default), the aim of 
this project is threeford:

1. Determine the relative impacts of different persons' characteristics on their likelihood to default on a loan.
2. Provide easily and quickly interpretable visualizations of the above findings.
3. Create models to predict whether a given person should be expected to default on a loan.

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is currently expected to be completed in 
early October 2023.
