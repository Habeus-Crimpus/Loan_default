## Overview of the Project

Based on the ![Coursera loan default prediction challenge]('https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction#details'), this project covers the development of machine learning models that predicts whether a loan will ultimately default. Written using Python, SQL, and Jupyter notebooks, the project began in mid-September and the first version of the report is expected to be completed in late September/early October.

As of September 30, 2023, the best performing models are **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**:

**NOTE:** The final report--*Loan_Default_Full_Report.ipynb*--is currently a draft and has not been proofed. All code is functional but there may be syntactical errors.

## History of the Project

* Update 1: Data imported, cleaned, and first visuals developed.
* Update 2: Logistic regression model created as baseline.
* Update 3: Multiple classification models developed and tested; random forest and xgboost models selected for further refinement.
* Update 4: Cross validation and Grid Search used to find optimal parameters for models; final models developed.
* Update 5: Full report sections 1-3 drafts complete
* Update 6: ONGOING; modeling sections drafts being written.

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is also being developed by me alone and so, may be subject to an inconsistent update schedule.
