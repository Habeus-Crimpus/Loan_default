## Overview of the Project

Based on the ![Coursera loan default prediction challenge]("https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction#details"), this project covers the development of machine learning models that predicts whether a loan will ultimately default. Utilizing Python libraries including *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, and *sklearn*, two models with XGBoost and Random Forest designs deliver accuracies above 92% with similarly strong performances across other classification metrics.

The project began in mid-September. Version 1 was release September 30th, 2023. 

Version 2, which is intended to include an expanded number of models tested and alternative tuning of the hyperparameters, is expected to be released in mid/late October 2023.

## History of the Project

* Update 1: Data imported, cleaned, and first visuals developed.
* Update 2: Logistic regression model created as baseline.
* Update 3: Multiple classification models developed and tested; random forest and xgboost models selected for further refinement.
* Update 4: Cross validation and Grid Search used to find optimal parameters for models' accuracies; final models developed.
* Update 5: Full report sections 1-3 drafts complete
* Update 6: Version 1 of the full report complete
* Update 7: ONGOING; version 1 proofing and small fixes ongoing

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is also being developed by me alone and so, may be subject to an inconsistent update schedule.
