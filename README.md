## Overview of the Project

Based on the ![Coursera loan default prediction challenge]("https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction#details"), this project covers the development of machine learning models that predicts whether a loan will ultimately default. Utilizing Python libraries including *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, and *sklearn*, two models with XGBoost and Random Forest designs deliver accuracies above 92% with similarly strong performances across other classification metrics.

## History of the Project

* *Version 1*: Released on September 30th, 2023, it covered the development of multiple models, ultimately suggesting the use of either an XGBoost or Random Forest model.
* *Version 2*: Expected to released in early November 2023, it will include the addition of a heatmap exploring feature correlation, a discussion of the importance of the features for the XGBoost and random forest models, and an ethical concerns section. Other improvements and small bug fixes will also be added (exact details pending development).

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is also being developed by me alone and so, may be subject to an inconsistent update schedule.
