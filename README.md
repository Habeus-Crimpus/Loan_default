## Overview of the Project

Based on the ![Coursera loan default prediction challenge]("https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-coding-challenge-loan-default-prediction#details"), this project covers the development of machine learning models that predicts whether a loan will ultimately default. Written using Python, SQL, and Jupyter notebooks, the project began in mid-September. Version 1 was release September 30th, 2023. Version 2, which is intended to include an expanded number of models tested and alternative tuning of the hyperparameters, is expected to be released in mid/late October 2023.

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is also being developed by me alone and so, may be subject to an inconsistent update schedule.
