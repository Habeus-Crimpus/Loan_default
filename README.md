# Loan Default Prediction Project
---
## Overview of the Project

Based on the loan default dataset sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhil1e9/loan-default), this project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will ultimately default. Written using Python, SQL, and Jupyter notebooks, the project began in mid-September and is expected to be completed in late September/early October.

## History of the Project

* Update 1: Data imported, cleaned, and first visuals developed.
* Update 2: Logistic regression model created as baseline.
* Update 3: Multiple classification models developed and tested; random forest and xgboost models selected for further refinement.
* Update 4: Cross validation and Grid Search used to find optimal parameters for models; final models developed.
* Update 5: Full report sections 1-3 drafts complete
* Update 6: ONGOING; modeling sections drafts being written.

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work-in-progress and may undergo significant changes in scope and design as the project progresses. It is also being developed by me alone and so, may be subject to an inconsistent update schedule.
